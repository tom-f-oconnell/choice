## multishock Arduino library

Wiring/Arduino library to control shock delivery and measurement board. 
Can deliver up to 150v to 16 channels, and measure current through each of them.

### Installation

Copy the `libraries/multishock` directory to one of the library folders for 
your current Arduino installation. This may be `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/`,
but search online for other situations. This is generally how Arduino 
libraries are installed.

### Usage

See example sketches. After installing, open / re-open your IDE, and open one 
of the examples under `File->Examples->multishock`

### Testing assembly of the board

See sketches under `examples->tests` folder. Each should explain, at the top of
the file, how to determine whether the test was successful.
