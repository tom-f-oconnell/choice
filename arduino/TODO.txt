maybe break this stuff out in to its own repo (for sure, the shock library)
	-and subtree / module it? or just keep separate?

(might make some people think this is arduino code for stimulus here, as is)

3. (maybe using one of the makefile solutions) put test code, using the library,
   in the same level as lib / libraries (this directory)
   -include instructions on how to build it (reference install if want to use 
    arduino IDE, because stupid lack of support for sketch-relative library 
    includes)
   -maybe fix Arduino sketch-relative library imports and pull request?
    , or otherwise determine why that hasn't been done yet
   -maybe don't use any build solution that needs other tools, and include a 
    script to just copy library / symlink into test code sketch directory?

4. maybe also try to get it in Library Manager and reference that option
5. include a zip of it?
