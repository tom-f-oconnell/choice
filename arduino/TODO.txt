maybe break this stuff out in to its own repo (for sure, the shock library)
	-and subtree / module it? or just keep separate?
	-I think I want to subtree multishock library
	 -should also include automation for setting up subtree / pushing to it

(might make some people think this is arduino code for stimulus here, as is)
-include it as an example somehow? (automatically, in arduino library)

3. (maybe using one of the makefile solutions) put test code, using the library,
   in the same level as lib / libraries (this directory)
   -include instructions on how to build it (reference install if want to use 
    arduino IDE, because stupid lack of support for sketch-relative library 
    includes)
   -maybe fix Arduino sketch-relative library imports and pull request?
    , or otherwise determine why that hasn't been done yet

4. maybe also try to get it in Library Manager and reference that option
5. include a zip of it?
