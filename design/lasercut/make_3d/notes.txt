layers that are having problems in conversion through scad:
-servo_arm
-yellow_manifold

-6.2 vacuum trap tops will probably have issues, but it seems it wasn't generated,
 and i'm not sure why?
	-may want to handle all layers w/ blue separately?
	-break in to two layers?

-also, i'm pretty sure it is a block definition (re, the hatch, splines) that is scaring openscad, even if it isn't used in current layer
