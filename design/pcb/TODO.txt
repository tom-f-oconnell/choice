decide whether to keep shield sch / footprint lib above, and then make sure versions in project
dir are current if deleting old masters

resolve conflicts between "rescue" (kicad dev v4->v5) derived project specific
schematic libraries with same-level schematic library i had made before
-PARTS SHOULD ONLY BE IN ONE OR THE OTHER, SAME-LEVEL IF SHARED...

make silkscreen prettier on shield board
	-(better) orientation information for FETs and diodes
	-less overlap / more consistency in orientation
	-larger github reference
	-isolation barrier depiction
	-warnings / descriptions of test points / bypass

don't have zone on B.Cu overlap with any metal parts on arduino
	-other ways to improve isolation?
tell people to assemble circuit board shortest components to tallest
	-maybe with some exceptions?
		-any stuff you can bend long pins on?
	-so that those components can be flush on the surface during assembly

reverse voltage protection on hv power supply

maybe get all DIP sockets as the kind that have pins bent in alternating directions, 
for easier soldering?

bigger holes for connector to power supply! if i don't find a better connector or
integrate the high voltage supply

some kind of autogenerated instruction at least grouping components by type?
(kicad seems to support some instances of this, just pick one easy to automate?)


add LEDs to indicate:
-which fly is getting shocked (easiest, should be fine to split SR output)
-which fly is getting measured (easy: just show representation used, hard: convert to above)
 though the hard would be more quickly interpretable, other would require lookup table
 could silkscreen table on to board?

-pull them out to the edge, or just put on the main face of the board somewhere?
-good parts for edge LED arrays?

-good interface for testing?
-what all do i want to test?
	-just put reference I (through) / R / V (across) each channel?
	-ovp?
	-reverse voltage protection (non-existant now)?

-detect whether mosfets are installed correctly?
	-why did i want to do this again? hoping to get rid of zeners?

-auto fill git repo information into version field on pcb during plotting

-make one version of shield board that is all surface mount?
	-would be interested in cost difference
-change diodes to through hole on existing through hole board
