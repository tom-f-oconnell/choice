decide whether to keep shield sch / footprint lib above, and then make sure versions in project
dir are current if deleting old masters

resolve conflicts between "rescue" (kicad dev v4->v5) derived project specific
schematic libraries with same-level schematic library i had made before
-PARTS SHOULD ONLY BE IN ONE OR THE OTHER, SAME-LEVEL IF SHARED...

make silkscreen prettier on shield board
	-(better) orientation information for FETs and diodes
	-less overlap / more consistency in orientation
	-larger github reference
	-isolation barrier depiction
	-warnings / descriptions of test points / bypass

don't have zone on B.Cu overlap with any metal parts on arduino
	-other ways to improve isolation?
