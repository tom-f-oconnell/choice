copying important section here:
To generate the gerbers in pcbnew, click plot icon or File->Plot. This Wayne and Layne post on Gerber generation was super helpful here.

    Layers, probably F.Cu (Top Copper), B.Cu(Bottom Copper) F.Paste(Top Solder Paste) F.Silk (Top Silkscreen), B.Silk (Bottom Silkscreen), B.Mask (Bottom soldermask), F.Mask (Top soldermask)

    Options, You might have other stuff checked, but the important one is to make sure Exclude PCB edge layer from other layers is unchecked as Advanced doesn’t take a separate edge cuts layer. Another nicety is check use auxiliary axis as origin so when you view in gerbview the file is in the center of the screen.

    Gerber Options, click Protel filename Options.

    Finally, Click Plot.

Now to generate the drill file, click Generate Drill File.

    Drill Units, use inches
    Zeros format suppress leading zeros
    Drill Map doesn’t matter
    Files options uncheck mirror y, use minimal header, and if you have non plated holes, Advanced takes a separate file for plated and non plated so make sure merge pth and npth holes into one file is unchecked.
    Drill Origin Auxiliary axis presuming you used “auxiliary axis as origin” in the plot screen. 
    Finally, click Drill File then Close and Close and you Gerbers are in your project directory under GerberOutput
