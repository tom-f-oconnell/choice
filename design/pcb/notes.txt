power usage (measured):
-v0.1 (manually fixed pinswaps on both power supply ICs)
-all digital chips in, no analog
-all other caps and resistors attached
-2 channels worth of FET / measurement resistors + diodes fully attached
-150R gate resistor on all other channels
-LEDs + 100R with + side on gate and - side on S, in each mosfet socket
-Uno 5V -> 10A fused connection on radioshack true rms meter, negative meter -> shield 5v Uno gnd <-> shield gnd
-Uno powered with 12v, 1A wall-wart. no USB cable connected.
-optoisolator inputs floating

~0.54 A on radioshack meter (on range w/ 1 digit to left of decimal point. in Amps.)
voltage at Vin +/- on DCP020507P (measured with a second meter): ~4.4-(4.6?)v

same, but w/ Mega R3 from Elegoo
v=(~4.4-4.3)->4.2->4.17->still dropping by hundreths of volts after test discontinued 
after a few seconds
I=0.5->0.32

(these two tests actually had the LED + resistors going from gate to drain,
 and so doing nothing, because there was no h.v. power supply attached.
 this was because pinswap of D and S by mistake in v0.1)

TODO why such poor regulation? 12v leaves plenty of headroom, shouldn't it?

TODO do some tests w/ better 5v bench supply, see what current draw would be

-> getting close to needing a separate supply, maybe doing away with the dcp020507
   and just having the lt1118 downstream of a wall wart or something (would need
   this power supply to provide isolation though...)

now with Uno and LED + resistors actually connected from gate to source
V=4.7->4.6ish
I=.625->.6
over maybe 10 seconds

in each of these tests, the Arduino's regulators have gotten fairly hot.
-maybe use diff input voltage?

optoisolator test (on PCB):
-using Uno w/ same wall-wart as above
-test code w/ TEST_ISOLATORS, 3000ms period, all isolator pins on/off
-all digital ICs other than optoisolators (also) disconnected

voltage on output pins of isolators (~0.23, 5) (low, high)
only arduino regulator seems to be getting hot, but not as much as it has
(felt through Arduino PCB)


(limited) test of overvoltage protection
-testing one channel on one of the v0.1 pcbs.
-one channel D->S shunted, no MOSFETs in
-two channels on this PCB fully constructed (diodes, etc) (0 and 15)
    -only these two channels had D,S swap fixed
-other channels just have gate resistor
-all other circuitry assembled (two amplifiers not in sockets though)

3mA @ 120v. for some reason, zener on this channel never seemed to exceed ~2.2V
(test w/ isolated 39K resistor in series w/ same zener produced either 0.8V one
way, or expected 4.8-5.1V the other way)

-using sper scientific 800005 w/ what seems like a K type probe
    -only really able to get a small fraction of the probe's surface on the
     tested part, rest is just exposed to air
    -after ~1-3min @ 120v (was probably still ~3.1mA whole time)
     39K 1W resistor: ~46C (might have seen 48C once)
     zener diode (maybe larger b/c proximity to 39K?: 36(-38?)C
     measurement resistor also in low to mid 30s (presumably entirely b/c
     proximity to 39K)

    -probe is at least also reading ~24.3 @ RT (not sure about calibration
     though). no real reason to think it is off, but haven't tested.
