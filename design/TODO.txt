-redesign frame to eliminate need for flat inside corner connectors
 (the ones with the nubs that are cheaper, particularly for 20mm)

-redesign side panelling to snap on? magnets?

-redo LED mounts to not require / benefit from milling mounting slots

-redo bottom of enclosure s.t. does not depend on extending to table
 surface for being light proof

-better light proof entries for wire / tubing than what I use now
 (gaffers tape)

-BOM and instructions!!

-are risers still required for mounting chambers flush?
 -redo to eliminate need for them if so
 -otherwise include design files for them

-add designs showing mounting slots in aluminum sheet, where to put LEDs,
 and maybe add holes for possibly mounting a heatsink
	-good way to attach LED strips to it? get thermal paste / epoxy?
	 does their sticky coating null that?

-is way LEDs are wired up likely to cause illumination / temperature gradient?

-what's an appropriate way to power them? do people just use constant current
 drivers to achieve more brightness or what? control? wouldn't higher voltage
 have same effect of constant current or not?
	-if i'm going to stick with wall wart, filter output?
	 (i.e. is the power supply, camera, or the LEDs the most likely reason
	  K sometimes has lighting flickers? more than the one?)

-some way to basically make this a one click order thing? / useful BoM format?
