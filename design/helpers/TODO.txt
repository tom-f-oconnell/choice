remember to git subtree push / script it
git subtree push --prefix=design/helpers/kicad_holes hole_fixing_plugin master

are there existing plugins to take input of component coordinates or something and place
components?
	-maybe turn make_board into something like that?

maybe also add support to existing arraying tools s.t. a route between two can be copied to 
others?
	-commercial ways this is done? seems ugly to not have it repeated
	-alternatives w/in kicad? just copy somehow?
	-maybe also allow for things like flipping every other (which i might need)
	 to avoid mounting holes and stuff
