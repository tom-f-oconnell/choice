split metric change charts up by which odor was reinforced
(in addition to current plots)

store notes on age, density (?), time of day, time of starvation
(and generate information re: which odor was trained) to plot
metric changes for each of these as well, for debugging

instead of saying "nan" if metric cannot be computed, say "n/a"? (in notes
embedded in plots)

also group traces by experiment, to more easily view problems specific to
experiments
