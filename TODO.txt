add facilities for testing valves before trials.
	-service?

pause until user signals they have connected everything before
starting acquisition? just run trial structure generator in 
advance as before?

FIX STIMULUS PARAMETER SAVING (FROM TRACKER, OR REPEAT IN THIS LAUNCH) WHEN TRACKING CONCURRENTLY

copy stimulus parameters to retracked directory (maybe any pickle files?)

only start shock after the fly has experienced the odor

include scripts to help automate setup of key pair for secure rsync
and include optional path in probably save_data_to_hdf5, maybe 
another data saving node, to copy data via rsync in shutdown
hook
-should i start retracking locally under any circumstances? (leaning towards no, if aiming for max experiment uptime)

why were some experiments mising roi_NX.yaml files, but not others?

-install script (rosinstall?) for tracking and everything
 (w/ verified versions of dependencies!)
 -zip up all code and host / backup?
-maybe make a subset of the code installable for analysis w/o ROS
 -at least another install script, maybe pip?
