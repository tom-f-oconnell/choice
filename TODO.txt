- add facilities for testing valves before trials.
	 - service?

- pause until user signals they have connected everything before starting
  acquisition? just run trial structure generator in advance as before?

- FIX STIMULUS PARAMETER SAVING (FROM TRACKER, OR REPEAT IN THIS LAUNCH) WHEN
  TRACKING CONCURRENTLY

- copy stimulus parameters to retracked directory (maybe any pickle files?)

- only start shock after the fly has experienced the odor

- include scripts to help automate setup of key pair for secure rsync and
  include optional path in probably save_data_to_hdf5, maybe another data saving
  node, to copy data via rsync in shutdown hook
- should i start retracking locally under any circumstances? (leaning towards
  no, if aiming for max experiment uptime)

- why were some experiments missing roi_NX.yaml files, but not others?

- install script (rosinstall?) for tracking and everything
  (w/ verified versions of dependencies!)
  - zip up all code and host / backup?
- maybe make a subset of the code installable for analysis w/o ROS
  - at least another install script, maybe pip?

-add configuration to run a trial, but w/ no odors, or change the odor
 configuration s.t. it's easier to have the software realize nothing you don't
 want to connect anything (for troubleshooting experiments)

- some kind of central (maybe Github repo based) collection of various
  parameters

- orient plots s.t. the starting odor is always on the same side?
  - one reason to not do this, is it would make it harder to see spatial
    bias by eye
  - could also just group them by orientation, then which odor was shocked,
    and then whether the shocked odor came first? or something like that?
